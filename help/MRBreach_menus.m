%% Menu Options
% Summary of the options available for each drop down menu.

%% File
% * *New*: clears any existing model (prompting to save if not already saved) and a popup dialog box prompts for Project name and Date (default is current date). 
% * *Open*: existing Asmita models are saved as *.mat files. User selects a model from dialog box.
% * *Save*: save a file that has already been saved.
% * *Save as*: save a file with a new or different name.
% * *Exit*: exit the program. The close window button has the same effect.

%% Tools
% * *Refresh*: updates Cases tab.
% * *Clear all > Project*: deletes the current project, including all Setup data and all Cases.
% * *Clear all > Figures*: deletes all results plot figures (useful if a large number of plots have been produced).
% * *Clear all > Cases*: deletes all Cases listed on the Cases tab but does not affect the model setup.

%% Project
% * *Project Info*: edit the Project name and Date
% * *Cases > Edit Description*: user selects a Case to edit the Case description.
% * *Cases > Edit Data Set*: initialises the Edit Data UI for editing data sets.
% * *Cases > Save*: user selects a data set to be saved from a list box of Cases and the is then prompted to name the file. The data are written to an Excel spreadsheet. 
% * *Cases > Delete*: user selects Case(s) to be deleted from a list box of Cases and results are then deleted (model setup is not changed).
% * *Cases > Reload*: user selects a Case to reload as the current parameter settings.
% * *Cases > View settings*: user selects a Case to display a table listing the parameters used for the selected Case. 
% * *Export/Import > Export*: user selects a Case class instance to export as a mat file.
% * *Export/Import > Import*: user selects an exported Case class instance (mat file) to be loaded.

%% Setup
% * *Hydraulic Parameters*: dialogue to define hydraulic input parameters.
% * *Site Parameters*: dialogue to define site input parameters.
% * *Site Hypsometry*: dialogue to import hypsometry data from a file.
% * *Model Constants*: a number of constants are used in the model. Generally, the default values are appropriate but these can be adjusted and saved with the project if required.

%%
% The import file format for hypsometry data is an ascii file with two header lines,
% followed by two columns of data defining elevation (mOD) andplan area (m^2).

%% Run
% * *Set Hypsometry*: generates plot of hypsometry based on user settings
% and allows user to adjust the fit parameters for use in the model
% * *Run Model*: runs model, prompts for a Case description, which is added to the listing on the Cases tab.
% * *Derive Output*: initialises the Derive Output UI to select and define manipulations of the data or call external functions and load the result as new data set.

%% Analysis
% * *Plots*: initialises the Plot UI to select variables and produce various types of plot. The user selects the Case, Dataset and Variable to used, along with the Plot type and any Scaling to be applied from a series of drop down lists, 
% * *Statistics*: initialiss the Statistics UI to select data and run a range of standard statistical methods.

%% Help
% * *Help*: access the online documentation for MRBreach.
